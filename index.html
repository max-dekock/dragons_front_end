    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      DragonWatch is an international organization that aggregates and analyzes dragon sightings to track dragon flight patterns in order to better understand their distribution and behavior.
      We rely on volunteers across the world to report dragon sightings, which are each then reviewed by an expert dragon analyst to identify specific individual dragons.</p>
    <p>
      The world dragon population is estimated to be around 2,000, with only about 10% of those being previously identified. DragonWatch employs 30 expert analysts to review submissions, with about 150 new sightings being reported each week.
      So far, around 3,500 volunteer dragon watchers have signed up.
